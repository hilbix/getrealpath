Current tinolib support, this means ANSI escaped output etc.

Note: To get old behavior, use 'getrealpath -o "arg"', else output is ANSI escaped.
This often does not make any difference, except you have unusual paths.

For example:

getrealpath "/a b" now outputs "/a\x20b"

getrealpath -o "/a b" outputs "/a b"
